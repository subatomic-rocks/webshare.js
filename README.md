# webshare.js
ðŸ“¤ A simple and effective wrapper to Web Sharing API with HTML fallback.

## Usage
Add the ``webshare.bundle.min.js`` from our ``dist`` directory to the bottom of your page, then call ``webshare.render(element)`` while passing the target element to render the icons on as argument.

For a better usage example, please check ``demo/index.html``

A better documentation will be added here later. ðŸ˜œ

## About
This was created as a experiment on the Web Share API, while keeping compatible with older browsers.
